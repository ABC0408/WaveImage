Dear professor, in the third semester, I had selected the master's thesis topic as "Generating high quality synthetic speech using GAN as
vocoder post-processing", since the generated speech still has a certain gap with real speech. 
Earlier, I wanted to find features to represent speech as image, then use the image translation to shorten the gap. But until now I
still didn't find the features to represent speech successfully, and so did anybody else. Hence, I want to change
the topic to "Generating high quality synthetic speech using GAN as vocoder preprocessing", only changing 'post-processing' to 
'preprocessing'.

This will be a continuation of my previous work(Reducing over-smoothness in speech synthesis using Generative Adversarial
Networks). Being similar, the only difference is to update the image-to-image translation framework to a newer state-of-art
framework(styleGan) and use WaveNet instead of Griffin-Lim algorithm as vocoder. It will be easier for me to complete
my master thesis.
